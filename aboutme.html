        <p>Hi! My full name is Pham Binh Phuong Minh Ha, my last name comes first and my first name is last. Because my name is too long, when I came to Canada I shortened it by Ha Pham or Mia Pham. I'm the mother of an 11-year-old princess and at this age she's getting a little cranky. My hobbies are eating and sleeping. I can eat anything I like anytime and sleep anywhere. I myself feel very lazy in sports activities, even walking makes me bored. Because I was afraid that my brain would shrink and disappear, I signed up to go back to school. I'm kidding. Since my daughter can take care of herself after school, I don't need to spend much time with her, so I want to take advantage of going back to school.  My goal is I can get a job to buy me delicious food and save money for my daughter to go to college or university later.</p>
